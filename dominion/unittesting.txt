The coverage of gcov for my unit tests start from 16% up to 26%. The lowest gcov percentage is the unit tests for initializeGame and that because there are not cases to check compare to the other functions. However, the best coverage is testing the function council_roomCard which was refactored from the previous assignment.

My effort on this I started struggling on how to find bugs and do unit testing in order to find bugs. After I finished my first unit test I was able to understand more of the game’s api so I can do more of unit testing and test the logic for the game. For assert, I used the same function that was provided on the github repo’s example and I think it helped me to focus more on unit testing and avoid off topic work such as worrying about assert. Overall, testing the api function helped me to fear less of the long code, because of this I am comfortable changing the code behavior, also, the same goes for cards unit test I think cardeffect’s function should be shortened and refactored for easier debugging.
