Running the python script and comparing my dominion with my one of my classmate results to an interesting difference. The first difference is the coverage; my classmate’s dominion is always 1 percent higher. However, comparing the scores for each player during the game my dominion is less error in terms of score. I think this not a bad idea to test and see other dominions with small changes and able to see the changes. The generated difference file is not easy to follow since there are so many outputs. Overall, the differences are significantly huge and because of that it’s not easy to say which one is correct.
