Sourse of problem: council_room_function function

The function should draw four cards instead of three.

problem: 
    for(i=0; i<3; i++)
        drawCard(currentPlayer, state);

Solution:
    for(i=0; i<4; i++)
        drawCard(currentPlayer, state);

My assert message:

	FAILED ASSERTION: Test Failed: The difference in handcount before and after using council_room card is more or less than 4 cards.

Severity: Minor
Priority: Low
